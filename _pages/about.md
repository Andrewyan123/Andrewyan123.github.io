- Hello! My name is **Jianing Wang (王嘉宁)**.
- I'm a Ph.D student at East China Normal University (ECNU) (from Sep. 2019 to Jun. 2024) in Shanghai supervised by [Prof. Ming Gao](http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/mgao/), [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/), and [Prof. Yunshi Lan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q0F92XIAAAAJ) majoring Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I also visited at UCSD and supervised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~jmcauley/#) from Oct. 2023 to Feb. 2024.
<!-- - I'm the founder of [HugAILab](https://github.com/HugAILab), which is the open organization for AI researching and application. -->
- My research points consist of Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompt Learning, and Knowledge Graph.
<!-- - Now, I am now doing research on Prompt-based Learning and focusing on low-resource scenarios, cooperating with [Alibaba Group PAI](https://www.aliyun.com/) and [Alibaba DAMO Academy for Discovery](https://damo.alibaba.com/) from Mar. 2021 to Oct. 2022.  -->
- I have published some research papers at ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, CIKM, etc., including Knowledge-enhanced Pre-trained Language Models, Few-shot Question Answering, Low-resource Sequence Labeling and Prompt Learning. More details can be found in [Publications](https://wjn1996.github.io/publications/) and [Projects](https://wjn1996.github.io/projects/).
- I had some internship experiences, including Ant Group (Digital Finance, Jun. 2021) and Alibaba Group (Platform of AI, AIR intern, Sep. 2022).
- I like writing Chinese blogs at CSDN, sharing some papers and research knowledge of NLP, you can visit my Chinese blogs in [here](https://wjn1996.blog.csdn.net/).
- If you have any comments, please click [here](https://github.com/wjn1996/wjn1996/issues) to let me know!
