## HugNLP Open-source Library
* Paper: [[HugNLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14286)].
* Project Link: [https://github.com/wjn1996/HugNLP](https://github.com/wjn1996/HugNLP).
* Time: From 2023-01-01 to Now.
> HugNLP is a novel development and application library based on Hugging Face for improving the convenience and effectiveness of NLP researchers.

> HugNLP consists of a hierarchical structure including models, processors and applications that unifies the learning process of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on different NLP tasks.
Additionally, we present some featured NLP applications to show the effectiveness of HugNLP, such as knowledge-enhanced PLMs, universal information extraction, low-resource mining, and code understanding and generation, etc.


## EasyNLP Open-source Toolkit
* Paper: [[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-demos.3.pdf)].
* Project Link: [https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP).
* Time: From 2022-04-10 to Now.
> EasyNLP is an easy-to-use NLP development and application toolkit in PyTorch, first released inside Alibaba in 2021. It is built with scalable distributed training strategies and supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms for various NLP applications. 

> EasyNLP integrates knowledge distillation and few-shot learning for landing large pre-trained models, together with various popular multi-modality pre-trained models. It provides a unified framework of model training, inference, and deployment for real-world applications. 

>It has powered more than 10 BUs and more than 20 business scenarios within the Alibaba group. It is seamlessly integrated to Platform of AI (PAI) products, including PAI-DSW for development, PAI-DLC for cloud-native training, PAI-EAS for serving, and PAI-Designer for zero-code model training.
