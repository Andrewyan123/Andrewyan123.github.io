### HugNLP: A Unified and Comprehensive Library for Natural Language Processing
* Paper: [[HugNLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14286)].
* Project Link: [https://github.com/wjn1996/HugNLP](https://github.com/wjn1996/HugNLP).
> HugNLP is a novel development and application library based on Hugging Face for improving the convenience and effectiveness of NLP researchers.

> HugNLP consists of a hierarchical structure including models, processors and applications that unifies the learning process of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on different NLP tasks.
Additionally, we present some featured NLP applications to show the effectiveness of HugNLP, such as knowledge-enhanced PLMs, universal information extraction, low-resource mining, and code understanding and generation, etc.
