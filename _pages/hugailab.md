        The <b>HugAI Lab</b> is found by <a href="https://wjn1996.github.io">Jianing Wang</a> at the <b>East China Normal University</b>. Our group is an open and working on some related research works on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), focusing on prompt-based learning, large language models, low-resource learning. We have developed a unified and comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/HugAILab/HugNLP">HugNLP</a> library for improve convenience of research and development.
